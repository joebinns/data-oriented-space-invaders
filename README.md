# Data Oriented Space Invader
An assignment made for Futuregames course "Computer Technology".

## Controls
Use <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> to move.

## Features
Being my first time working with Data Oriented Programming, this project came with it's fair share of lessons.
I decided to focus my learning on Unity's Entity Component System (ECS) and profiler.
As such, I learnt to use unmanaged datatypes with distinguished entities, components and systems.
With the Job System, I used Burst Compilation to optimise the performance of various systems: player movement, invader movement, projectile spawning and projectile movement.
For greater consistency whilst profiling, I opted to spawn projectiles in large numbers at a fixed frequency.

- [x] Simple movement
- [x] Shooting
- [x] Waves of enemies

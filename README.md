# Data Oriented Space Invader
An assignment made for Futuregames course "Computer Technology".

## Controls
Use <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> to move.

## Features
Being my first time working with Data Oriented Programming, this project came with it's fair share of lessons.
I decided to focus my learning on Unity's Entity Component System (ECS) and profiler.
With the Job System I used Burst Compilation to optimise performance of various systems.
These systems included the projectile spawners, player movement and invader movement.
For added consistency whilst profiling, I ended up shooting projectiles at a fixed interval.

- [x] Simple movement
- [x] Shooting
- [x] Waves of enemies
